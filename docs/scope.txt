Stock Price Trend Prediction Scope
Last Updated: June 22, 2025, 02:25 PM IST

Project Goal:
- Develop a dynamic system to predict the next-day closing price of any stock using a linear regression model, with Tesla (TSLA) as the initially selected stock.

Data Source:
- Alpha Vantage API (free tier, daily stock data for the selected stock).
- Time frame: 1 year of daily data (January 1, 2024 - December 31, 2024) for the initially selected stock, TSLA.

Features:
- Previous day's closing price.
- Daily trading volume.
- 5-day moving average of closing price.

Model:
- Linear regression to predict the next day's closing price based on selected features.

Deliverables:
- Python scripts for data retrieval, processing, and model training, supporting dynamic stock selection.
- Trained linear regression model saved in /models folder, named dynamically (e.g., /models/<stock>_linear_regression.joblib).
- Evaluation report with metrics (e.g., mean squared error) and visualizations (e.g., predicted vs. actual prices) for the selected stock.
- GitHub repository (stock-price-prediction) with organized code, data, and documentation.

DevOps Requirements:
- Automated script to pull daily data from Alpha Vantage API for the selected stock.
- Automated data cleaning pipeline to prepare data for the model.
- GitHub repository for version control, with folders: /data, /scripts, /models, /docs.
- Scheduled updates (e.g., weekly) to fetch new data and retrain the model for the selected stock.

Success Criteria:
- Model achieves reasonable accuracy (e.g., low mean squared error on test data) for the selected stock.
- Pipeline runs without errors, with data and model outputs saved correctly for the selected stock.
- GitHub repo is well-documented with a README and clear code structure.

Note: The system is designed for dynamic stock selection, with TSLA as the initial stock. Users can switch to other stocks by updating the configuration or input parameters.
