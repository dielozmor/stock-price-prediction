Stock Price Trend Prediction Scope

Project Goal:
- Predict the next-day closing price of Tesla stock (TSLA) using a linear regression model.

Data Source:
- Alpha Vantage API (free tier, daily stock data).
- Time frame: 1 year of daily data (January 1, 2024 -  December 31, 2024).

Features:
- Previous day's closing price.
- Daily trading volume.
- 5-day moving average of closing price.

Model:
- Linear regression to predict the next day's closing price based on selected features.

Deliverables:
- Python scripts for data retrieval, processing, and model training.
- Trained linear regression model saved in /models folder.
- Evaluation report with metrics (e.g., mean squared error) and visualizations (e.g., predicted vs. actual prices).
- Github repository (stock-price-prediction) with organized code, data, and documentation.

DevOps requirements:
- Automated script to pull daily data from Alpha Vantage API.
- Automated data cleaning pipeline to prepare data for the model.
- Github repository for version control, with folders: /data, /scripts, /models, /docs.
- Scheduled updates (e.g., weekly) to fetch new data and retrain model.

Success Criteria:
- Model achieves reasonable accuracy (e.g., low mean squared error on test data).
- Pipeline line runs without errors, with data and model outputs saved correctly.
- GitHub repo is well-documented with a README and clear code structure.
